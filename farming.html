				<h1>Organic Farming
				</h1>
				<p>
					Organic farming is a method of agricultural production that involves the use of natural techniques
					and practices instead of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. The goal of organic farming is to
					create a sustainable system that supports the environment, produces healthy crops, and protects the
					health of farmers and consumers.

					Organic farming practices include a range of techniques aimed at preserving and enhancing soil
					quality, such as crop rotation, composting, and natural pest control. These practices also promote
					biodiversity and reduce the use of non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels.

					One of the key principles of organic farming is the avoidance of synthetic chemicals, which can harm
					the environment and pose health risks to farmers and consumers. Instead, organic farmers use natural
					methods to manage pests and maintain soil fertility, such as using beneficial insects, birds, or
					other predators to control pests naturally, or adding organic fertilizers like manure or compost to
					the soil.

					Organic farming is an important component of sustainable agriculture, and is becoming increasingly
					popular in India and around the world as consumers become more aware of the environmental and health
					benefits of organic products.

				<h1>Benefits of Organic Farming</h1>
				<p>
					<b>Economical: </b>In organic farming, no expensive fertilisers, pesticides, or HYV seeds are
					required for the
					plantation of crops. Therefore, there is no extra expense.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Good return on Investment:</b> With the usage of cheaper and local inputs, a farmer can make a
					good return on
					investment. <br>
					<br>

					<b>High demand: </b>There is a huge demand for organic products in India and across the globe, which
					generates more
					income through export. <br>
					<br>

					<b>Nutritional: </b>As compared to chemical and fertiliser-utilised products, organic products are
					more nutritional,
					tasty, and good for health. <br> <br>

					<b>Environment-friendly: </b>The farming of organic products is free of chemicals and fertilisers,
					so it does not
					harm the environment.

				<h1>Types of Organic Farming</h1>
				<p>There are mainly two types of organic farming : <br>
					<b>1 Pure Organic Farming :</b>
					This farming is one of the different types of organic farming. It essentially depends on organic
					compost, fertilizers, and bio-pesticides to cultivate crops. It rigidly forbids any inorganic
					chemical or pesticides that may influence the yield, positively or negatively. It includes the use
					of organic manures and bio-pesticides with the whole avoidance of inorganic chemicals and
					pesticides.

					In the method of pure farming, fertilizer and pesticides receive from natural sources. It is called
					a pure form of organic farming. This is the most suitable for high productivity.
					<br>

					<b>2 Integrated Organic Farming : </b>

					This farming is one of the standards of organic farming that merges the best of organic farming with
					nutrient management and integrated pest management. In this type of farming, producers grow crops
					utilizing natural resources, as they would in pure farming. However, they will use more inputs to
					improve their nutritional value and preserve the crops from pests.

					This method integrates pest management and nutrients management to achieve ecological necessities
					and economic requirements. This type involves growing the crop through natural and renewable means.
					This permits the maximum utilization of resources and enhances the productivity of production.
